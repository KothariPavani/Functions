        "Ans:\n",
        "In Python, polymorphism allows a method to have different behaviors based on the object that calls it, even when the method has the same name in different classes. With inheritance,\n",
        "a subclass can override a method from its superclass, providing specific behavior while maintaining the same interface.\n",
        "This allows for dynamic method binding, where the method that gets executed is determined at runtime based on the object's type, not the reference type."

        "Method chaining in Python is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object, one after another, in a single line of code. This is possible when each method\n",
        "returns the object itself (i.e., self), allowing for successive method calls.\n",
